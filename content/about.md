I am an experienced Splunk Architect with a background in Project Finance and IT Systems Administration (with a slight detour though running a restaurant). I have architected and administered Splunk installations from single instance trial license setups to multi site clusters ingesting tens of terabytes a day.

I have a deep understanding of Splunk internals, on both the indexing and the search side, and can use this knowledge to drive efficiency, improve detection and analysis, and reduce platform costs.

More recently I have been working with products like Cribl to understand how to help people move from legacy log analytics to the Observability pipelines of the future.
I look forward to meeting you and helping to solve your data challenges.
