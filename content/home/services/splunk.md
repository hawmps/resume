I have been a Splunk Consultant, Architect, Tech Lead, and Administrator for 7 years. Splunk is still the most cost effective tool for analysis of large sets of unstructured and semi-structured data. 

I have architected, deployed, and administered Splunk installations from single instance trial license setups to multi site clusters ingesting tens of terabytes a day, from version 6.x -> 9.x

I have worked with all of Splunks premium add ons such as Splunk Enterprise Security (ES), Splunk ITSI, and Splunk SOAR (formerly Phantom)

I have a deep understanding of Splunk internals, on both the indexing and the search side, and can use this knowledge to drive efficiency, improve detection and analysis, and reduce platform costs.

I also work users and other Splunk administartors to teach best practices in Search and Splunk administration.
