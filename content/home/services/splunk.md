I have architected and administered Splunk installations from single instance trial license setups to multi site clusters ingesting tens of terabytes a day.

I have a deep understanding of Splunk internals, on both the indexing and the search side, and can use this knowledge to drive efficiency, improve detection and analysis, and reduce platform costs.
