You can have the best tooling money can buy, but if people are not empowerd to use it then you have wasted your money. I love teaching users how to get the most out of tools. I also love to help my colleagues with their challenges, nothing makes life easier than a high performing team!

I have created bespoke training courses to target specific users of the Splunk platform. I'm happy doing training sessions one to one or to an audience of hundreds. 

As a technical lead I have mentored my more junior colleagues on advanced Splunk topics.
